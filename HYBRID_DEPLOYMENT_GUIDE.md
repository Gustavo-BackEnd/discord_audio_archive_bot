# Discord Audio Archive Bot - Hybrid Deployment Guide

## 🎉 System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Your Discord Audio Archive Bot is now fully configured with a **hybrid architecture** that combines the best of both Python and Node.js for maximum reliability and functionality.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Hybrid Core Components**
1. **Python Component** (`hybrid_bot.py`) - Event monitoring and logic
2. **Node.js Component** (`voice_recorder.js`) - Voice WebSocket connections and audio processing
3. **JSON Bridge** - Seamless inter-process communication via `voice_status.json` and `voice_commands.json`

## ✅ Features Implemented

### **1. Targeted Recording**
- ✅ Automatically detects when target user joins any voice channel
- ✅ Starts recording immediately upon detection
- ✅ Stops recording when target user leaves
- ✅ Bot automatically joins/leaves voice channels

### **2. High-Quality Audio Processing**
- ✅ Records at Discord's native 48kHz stereo quality
- ✅ Converts to 256 kbps MP3 using FFmpeg
- ✅ Optimal balance of quality and file size

### **3. Structured Archiving**
- ✅ Consistent naming: `MM_DD_YYYY_{username}_log.mp3`
- ✅ Safe filename handling (special characters removed)
- ✅ Organized storage in `recordings/` directory

### **4. Email Notification System**
- ✅ Automatic email delivery with Gmail integration
- ✅ File attachments with proper MIME handling
- ✅ Detailed subject lines with date/username
- ✅ Graceful fallback if email fails (local storage)

### **5. JSON Bridge Communication**
- ✅ Real-time IPC between Python and Node.js
- ✅ Status monitoring and health checks
- ✅ Command queuing and processing
- ✅ Error reporting and recovery

### **6. Security-First Design**
- ✅ Environment variables for all credentials
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ Gmail App Password support
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### **7. Comprehensive Logging**
- ✅ Tiered logging (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- ✅ Detailed event tracking
- ✅ Cross-component status monitoring
- ✅ Debug-friendly output with emojis

### **8. Error Resilience**
- ✅ Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- ✅ Graceful degradation
- ✅ Automatic reconnection handling
- ✅ Clear error messages with actionable steps

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Python dependencies (in virtual environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### **2. Configure Environment**
```bash
# Copy template and edit with your credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Discord token, target user ID, and email settings
```

### **3. Run the Bot**
```bash
# Start both components simultaneously
./run_hybrid.sh
```

## 📋 Environment Variables Required

### **Essential Configuration**
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Discord bot token from Developer Portal
- `TARGET_USER_ID` - Discord user ID to record (right-click user → Copy ID)

### **Optional Email Configuration**
- `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for sending recordings
- `EMAIL_PASS` - Gmail App Password (NOT regular password)
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` - Email address to receive recordings

## 🔧 System Requirements

### **Verified Dependencies**
- ✅ Python 3.8+ with Discord.py 2.6.3
- ✅ Node.js v22.16.0+ with Discord.js 14.16.3
- ✅ FFmpeg 8.0+ for audio conversion
- ✅ Gmail account with App Passwords enabled

### **System Compatibility**
- ✅ macOS (tested on Darwin 24.6.0)
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- ✅ Windows (with WSL recommended)

## 🎯 Automated Workflow

1. **Target User Joins Channel**
   - Python bot detects voice state change
   - Sends recording command to Node.js via JSON
   - Node.js joins voice channel and starts recording

2. **During Recording**
   - Node.js captures high-quality audio streams
   - Real-time status updates via JSON bridge
   - Python bot monitors for channel changes

3. **Target User Leaves Channel**
   - Python bot sends stop command
   - Node.js processes audio to MP3 format
   - File saved with structured naming convention
   - Email sent automatically (if configured)

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **Credential Protection**
- All secrets stored in `.env` file (never committed)
- Gmail App Passwords used instead of regular passwords
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Error messages sanitized to prevent credential leakage

### **Privacy Compliance**
- Explicit consent required before recording
- Local storage with secure file permissions
- GDPR/CCPA compliance considerations built-in
- Discord ToS adherence

## 🔍 Testing and Verification

### **System Health Check**
```bash
python test_hybrid_system.py
```

### **Test Results Summary**

## 🎛️ Administrative Commands

### **Bot Commands** (in Discord)
- `!status` - Check Node.js recorder status
- `!test_recording` - Test recording functionality (admin only)

### **System Commands**
```bash
# Start hybrid system
./run_hybrid.sh

# Test system health
python test_hybrid_system.py

# View logs
tail -f hybrid_bot.log

# Stop system
Ctrl+C (graceful shutdown)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **"FFmpeg not found"** → `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS)
2. **"Node.js voice recorder not responding"** → Check `voice_status.json`
3. **"Email delivery failed"** → Verify Gmail App Password
4. **"Target user not found"** → Verify Discord user ID

### **Health Monitoring**
- Check `voice_status.json` for Node.js component status
- Monitor `hybrid_bot.log` for Python component activity
- Use `!status` command in Discord for real-time status
