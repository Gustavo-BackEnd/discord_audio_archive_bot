## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### DO NOT create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Email:** Send details to the project maintainers via GitHub Issues (mark as security vulnerability)
2. **Include:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if known)
3. **Timeline:** Allow 90 days for response and fix before public disclosure

### What NOT to report as security issues:
- Questions about configuration
- Feature requests
- Non-security bugs
- Issues requiring physical access to the host machine

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Environment Variable Isolation:** All credentials stored in `.env` files
- **Input Validation:** Discord user IDs and email addresses validated
- **Error Sanitization:** No credentials exposed in logs or error messages
- **File Path Restrictions:** Audio files saved to controlled directories only
- **SMTP Security:** TLS/SSL encryption for email communications

### Access Controls
- **Administrator Commands:** Recording controls require Discord admin permissions
- **Token Scope:** Bot tokens should have minimal required permissions
- **Email Authentication:** App passwords recommended over regular passwords

## ‚ö° Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit `.env` files or credentials
- Use virtual environments for dependency isolation
- Regularly update dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
- Review logs for suspicious activity
- Monitor Discord API usage and rate limits

### For Operators
- **Bot Permissions:** Grant only necessary Discord permissions:
  - Connect (to join voice channels)
  - Speak (for voice activity)
  - Use Voice Activity (for recording)
  - Read Message History (for commands)
- **Email Security:** Use Gmail App Passwords, not regular passwords
- **System Security:** Run bot in isolated environment or container
- **Network Security:** Restrict outbound connections if possible

### For Users
- Only invite the bot to servers you trust
- Understand that voice communications will be recorded
- Verify bot permissions before granting access
- Report suspicious bot behavior immediately

## üîç Security Checklist
