# Contributing to Discord Audio Archive Bot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Discord Audio Archive Bot! This project is designed with security and privacy at its core, so all contributions must adhere to strict security guidelines.

## 🛡️ Security-First Development

### Before You Start
- **Review**: Read our [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) policy thoroughly
- **Understand**: This bot handles sensitive voice recordings and credentials
- **Compliance**: Ensure familiarity with privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### Security Requirements
All contributions must:
- ✅ Never expose credentials in code, logs, or error messages
- ✅ Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- ✅ Follow principle of least privilege
- ✅ Include comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Pass security review before merging

### 🔧 Code Contributions

#### Pull Request Process
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Develop** following our guidelines below
4. **Test** thoroughly with integration tests
5. **Document** any user-facing changes
6. **Security review** your own code first
7. **Submit** pull request with detailed description

#### Code Guidelines

**Python Code Style**
```python
# Follow existing patterns in bot.py
# Use type hints where appropriate
# Comprehensive error handling
# Descriptive variable names
# Security-first approach

def secure_function(user_input: str) -> bool:
    """
    Example function with proper security practices.
    
    Args:
        user_input: Validated input from user
        
    Returns:
        bool: Success status
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: For invalid input (sanitized message)
    """
    try:
        # Validate input
        if not isinstance(user_input, str) or len(user_input) == 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input provided")
            
        # Process safely
        result = process_input_safely(user_input)
        logger.info("Operation completed successfully")
        return True
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error without exposing sensitive data
        logger.error(f"Operation failed: {type(e).__name__}")
        return False
```

**Security Patterns**
```python
# ✅ Good: Environment variable usage
discord_token = os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')
if not discord_token:
    logger.error("Missing required environment variable: DISCORD_TOKEN")
    raise ValueError("Missing required environment variable")

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded credentials
discord_token = "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MA.GhIjKl.MnOpQrStUvWxYz"

# ✅ Good: Input validation
def validate_user_id(user_id: str) -> int:
    try:
        uid = int(user_id)
        if uid <= 0:
            raise ValueError("User ID must be positive")
        return uid
    except ValueError:
        logger.warning("Invalid user ID provided")
        raise

# ✅ Good: Error sanitization
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Database operation failed: {type(e).__name__}")
    return {"error": "Operation failed", "details": None}
```

**Testing Requirements**
All code changes must include:
```python
# Update test_integration.py with new test cases
def test_your_feature(self):
    """Test the new feature with comprehensive scenarios."""
    # Test normal operation
    assert your_feature_works()
    
    # Test error conditions
    with pytest.raises(ExpectedError):
        your_feature_with_bad_input()
    
    # Test security boundaries
    assert not your_feature_leaks_credentials()
```
